What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I found that it worked best for me to get my entire Computer class figured out and then move on to the Resale Shop class. My biggest struggle was getting the methods in my Resale Shop class to print error messages rather than stop running if they received an item ID not in the shop inventory. Once I turned my shop inventory into a list instead of a nested dictionary, I was able to get that part of my program running correctly. My advice to a future student is to go to TA hours and office hours. I was overcomplicating the assignment and going to office hours helped me realize that.
